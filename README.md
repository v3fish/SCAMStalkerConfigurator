# Stalker Configurator Aiming & Movement (SCAM)

GUI tool for S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl to configuring vaulting, movement, and aiming parameters.
This tool makes changes to the Player only and uses a different approach that doesn't directly modify ObjPrototypes.cfg,
so every mod should be compatible.

- Play how you like with a Easy-to-use interface for adjusting movement and aiming settings
- Save and load custom presets
- Built-in recommended configurations
- Automatic mod creation and installation
- Mouse smoothing/acceleration removal utility
- 1:1 XY Sensitivity Fix Included
- Compatible with everything (so far)
